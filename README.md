### Welcome to the 'Daily Planner' app 📆 
Planning can be stressful 🤯  and boring 🥱  at times, but we can't ignore its importance if we want to stay on top of our commitments. Our amazing product team has developed the next-gen [Daily Planner app](https://yulduzetta.github.io/daily-planner/) that makes your planning experience efficient and intuitive.

**Features**:
✔️ This app is a perfect tool for you to keep track of your daily schedule and tasks. 
✔️ Coloring scheme is used to indicate whether the event already happened (gray), about to expire (red), or will take place in future (green).
✔️ You should be able to add, update and/or delete your tasks. Please note that unsaved changes will not persist on browser refresh.

**To run the app, please follow either of the steps below:**
- for remote run, simply navigate to https://yulduzetta.github.io/daily-planner/
