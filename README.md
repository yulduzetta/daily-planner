### Welcome to the 'Daily Planner' app 📆 
Planning can be stressful 🤯  and boring 🥱  at times, but we can't ignore its importance if we want to stay on top of our commitments. Our amazing product team has developed the next-gen [Daily Planner app](https://yulduzetta.github.io/daily-planner/) that makes your planning experience efficient and intuitive.

**Features**:

1. This app is a perfect tool for you to keep track of your daily schedule and tasks. 
2. Coloring scheme is used to indicate whether the event already happened (gray), about to expire (red), or will take place in future (green).
3. You should be able to add, update and/or delete your tasks. Please note that unsaved changes will not persist on browser refresh.

**To run the app, please follow either of the steps below:**
- for remote run, simply navigate to https://yulduzetta.github.io/daily-planner/
